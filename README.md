# HartreeFock-ZGNR
 Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations for zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR)



# Plan 

In terms of writing the code, consider to write it the style of **class** in Python.

Before doing so, just write it simple.

<!-- Rename it? HartreeFock_ZGNR. -->


Rememeber to add the citation to my thesis.


For each calculation type, make it in an example folder.


`HF_spinspliting.py` returns the eigensystems only
